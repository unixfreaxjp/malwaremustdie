# radare2 for UNIX/Linux servers support in 2020 (attention: r2jp community)

Translation of the [r2jp/doc in here](https://github.com/radareorg/r2jp/blob/master/UNIXServerCompatibilityReportJP.md)

## Background

I would like to conclude radare2 compatibility test results so far and summarize the for UNIX server versions that are not supported. The range for tests is from version 3.9.0 to the 4.4.0 and now in progress testing for [radare2 version 4.5.0](https://github.com/radareorg/radare2/releases/tag/continuous).

The background is, we had a serioys meeting with pancake on December 2019 (@SECCON 2019) in Tokyo and discussed we should be clarified about which server systems that can be committedto be supported for bugdix and which are not for this year (2020).

The conclusion is as follows. (The contents is initially written for R2JP/r2 Japanese comunity as standard deployment guide for NIX servers and native embedded Linux devices)

## Support information

Conclusion of versions that are currently supported and those that are not:

*) unsupported = Has not been supported since 2020, supported = will be supported until firther notice, core= r2 package/without plug-in

## Details of issues from tests in NIX servers OS↓(v4.3.0 to v4.4.0 base / core) so far:

Listed problems  in evaluation:
- All supported versions for the above tests are for x64 bit CPUs,  x32bit CPU servers are currently uncommitted for testing and bugfix issue escalation, r2jp users is advised to use the `radare2 4.0.0-git` version for x86_32. The 32bits for non Intel native buiild will be supported in an OS version as long as that version is on supported period in their distribution (`LTSE` for Debian, `LTS' for CentOS, `Production Releases` for FreeBSD, etc).
- r2ghidra fails to compile in Debians before Buster, and I get `isnan` `isinf` errors w/ "ambiguous" flag, it's a CPP compatibility issue on GCC lib-error on coding layer, currently r2ghidra has no solution for this.
- r2ghidra plugins failed completely on CPP library compatible in BSD platforms. Due the BSD platforms is currently out of support context by radare plugin developers.
- Throughout the BSD test scheme, r2dec is having issues of building "duktape", under same development status as previous point.
- FreeBSD x32 is currently not supported, but the latest result is as below ↓

      FreeBSD 9.x-12.x on x86,: core = OK ,: r2ghidra = NG, r2dec = NG.
- The Debian Stretch x32 test is no longer committed, but the latest result is as are below ↓

      Debian Stretch x86,: core = OK ,: r2ghidra = NG, r2dec = OK.
- OpenBSD is still on evaluation. I will report the information again.
- We will inform you about the latest version of NetBSD later,

## Stable OS integration information.

Tsurugi [SECCON 2019 Special Edition](https://blog.0day.jp/p/20191218.html) is the first stable Linux distribution with r2, pdc, r2ghidra and r2dec integration.

```

```

- (core: OK ,: r2ghidra = OK, r2dec = OK)
- VM can be installed with ISO, so you can also install the VM on the x32 server.
- We will add information as soon as we confirm the test results for other Tsurugi Linux versions.
- Currently the retdec decompiler integration is under test and development.
